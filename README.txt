                            P1 Contribution Report

We decided to do the project in JAVA for the unlimited precision arithmetic, 
though with Evan not knowing JAVA, his contributions were converted to JAVA from CPP by Sean. 

Sean: Functions in JAVA {main, encode}. 
      Converted all CPP code to JAVA.
      Finalized format and comments.
      Tested {encode, count}
      
Evan: Functions in CPP {delta, decode, count}
      Tested {delta, decode}

Together we talked a lot about the strategy we would use for all the functions, 
doing them on paper togethor before coding aswell.
